1. Direct Recursion
2. Indirect Recursion
3. Tail Recursion
4. Non-tail Recursion


Direction Recursion:

Function called direct in the function

fun(){
	#code
	fun()
	#code
}


Indirect Recursion:

Function is called indirectly ie function inside another function

fun(){
	#code
	fun2()
	#code
}


fun2(){
	#code
	fun()
	#code
}

Tail Recursion:

Recursive call is the last thing done by the function, no need of stack to keep record of previos state

fun(){
	#code
	fun()

} 


Non tail recursive:

Just oppite of tail recuresion

fun(){
	fun()
	#code
}
